# TreeMap
This app was designed to help tree stewards manage an inventory of plants distributed across a large area, e.g. a city or neighborhood.
Users can 
- mark asset locations on a map
- store associated asset data
- display and edit data
- display a filtered view based on asset criteria

## Motivation
This is a sample project to familiarize myself with the Android platform. Don't expect ongoing maintenance.

## Installation
You'll need your own Google Maps API key in order to run this. You can get it free at https://console.developers.google.com/.
